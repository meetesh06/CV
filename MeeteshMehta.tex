\cvsection[page1sidebar]{About}

\begin{justifying}
  \noindent
  I'm a research scholar at IIT Bombay working in the area of compilers.
  My latest work focuses on the static analysis and optimization of JavaScript programs.
  We are currently developing a new static analysis framework called IRIDIUM which aims to precisely model the ECMAScript 2025 language specification to enable a more systematic study of JavaScript programs.
  In the past I have worked with the R programming Language where we tackled problems of JIT code reuse, warmup time reduction and introduced the concept of speculative contextual dispatch.
  I absolutely love everything about computers and love to dive deeper into what makes them tick.
  I find myself comfortable in high level abstractions as well as low level things like code generation, assembly, C++.
  Apart from computers I also tinker a lot with Raspberry Pi's, Arduino's, etc in my free time.

\cvsection[page2sidebar]{Projects}

\cvproject{Contributed to Coffre @ IITB}
\begin{itemize}
\item The Coffre Virtual Machine is Prof. Uday Khedker's brainchild that provides students with a secure environment to complete their coursework while reducing instructor workload by preventing plagiarism. I was incharge of updating and patching security vulnerabilities that were identified during its operation in 2023, subsequently a detailed report was created and after which work on a new VM began. The current implementation focuses on tight integration of the kernel and the hypervisor along with kernel level enforcement of TLS for transparent authentication.
\end{itemize}

\cvproject{Runtime vizualizer for contextual dispatch}
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed a runtime visualizer to study the impact of contextual dispatch on the \rsh{} Virtual Machine.
\end{itemize}

\cvproject{Points-to debugger}
\begin{itemize}
\item For my mini project in the CS 611 (Program Analysis) course, I created a debugger for the vasco framework. This tool allows developers to visualize the points-to graph generation process in Java programs, providing valuable insights into program behavior.
\end{itemize}

\cvproject{XOPE Programming language}
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed as a part of B.Tech final year project, this is a compiler that implements a beginner friendly frontend and generates X86\_64 assembly. Made open source GitHub (\href{https://github.com/meetesh06/xope_4.2}{GitHub}).
\end{itemize}
\smallskip
\cvproject{Campus Story}
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed an app to simplify information flow in educational institutions to students. The app was developed using React Native for iOS, Android and web platforms. Made open source GitHub (\href{https://github.com/meetesh06/CampusStory}{GitHub}).
\end{itemize}
\smallskip
\cvproject{CompL Validator}
\begin{itemize}
\item Developed as an aid to speedup assignment evaluation at IIT Mandi. This is a set of tools and libraries for backend/frontend to allow easier integration and evaluation of moodle submissions (\href{https://github.com/CompL-Research/CompL-Evaluator-Backend}{GitHub}).
\end{itemize}
