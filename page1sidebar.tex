\cvsection{Projects}

\cvproject{Contributed to Coffre @ IITB}
\begin{itemize}
\item The Coffre Virtual Machine provides students with a secure environment to complete their coursework while reducing instructor workload by preventing plagiarism. I was incharge of updating and patching security vulnerabilities that were identified during its operation in 2023, subsequently a detailed report was created and after which work on a new VM began. The current implementation focuses on tight integration of the kernel and the hypervisor along with kernel level enforcement of TLS for transparent authentication.
\end{itemize}
